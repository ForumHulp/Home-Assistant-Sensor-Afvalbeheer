### Upcoming sensor
```yaml

If you activate this option you'll get 2 extra sensors (today and tomorrow) which are handy for automations. 
The today sensor will display the fractions collected today.
The tomorrow sensor will display the fractions collected tomorrow.
Default is 0.

### Date format
```yaml
dateformat:
```
If you want to adjust the way the date is presented. You can do it using the dateformat option. All [python strftime options](http://strftime.org/) should work.
Default is '%d-%m-%Y', which will result in per example: 
```yaml
21-9-2019.
```
If you wish to remove the year and the dashes and want to show the name of the month abbreviated, you would provide '%d %b'. Which will result in: 
```yaml
21 Sep
```

dateonly: 1
